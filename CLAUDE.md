# Pramaan — GeM bid compliance verification

Landing page for **Pramaan**, a prototype built for **Smart India Hackathon 2026, Problem Statement
SIH26100**.

**The product concept:** procurement officers on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) must verify every
bidder against ~11 disconnected government portals (Udyam, GSTN, PAN/ITD, MCA21, EPFO, ESIC,
DigiLocker, NSIC, Startup India, Make in India/BIS-DPIIT, debarment registers). Pramaan queries them
automatically and produces one scored, auditable compliance record. **The officer still decides** —
this human-in-the-loop framing is central to the positioning and should never be softened into
"the AI approves bidders".

This repo is **frontend only** — a marketing site plus a clickable officer console. No backend,
no real API integration, no working auth. The user will say when to start on the backend.

## Stack & commands

Astro 4 static site. **Zero runtime dependencies** — no React/Vue/Tailwind. Plain `.astro`
components, one hand-written global stylesheet, small `is:inline` vanilla scripts.

```bash
npm run dev      # localhost:4321
npm run build    # -> dist/
npm run preview
```

## Deployment — read before touching links

Deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/` on push to `main`. The workflow builds with:

```
npx astro build --base /Gem-procurement
```

`astro.config.mjs` deliberately has **`site` but no `base`**, so local dev serves from `/` while
production serves from `/Gem-procurement/`.

**Consequence:** every internal link must go through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, never a bare `/`.

```astro
const base = import.meta.env.BASE_URL;   // "/" in dev, "/Gem-procurement/" in prod
<a href={`${base}login`}>          <!-- correct -->
<a href="/login">                  <!-- breaks in production -->
```

`base` always ends in a slash, so concatenate without one. Same-page anchors (`href="#how"`) are fine
bare; cross-page anchors must be `${base}#how` so they work from `/login`.

## Structure

```
src/
  layouts/Layout.astro      marketing pages: meta, OG/Twitter, canonical, inline SVG favicon
  layouts/AppLayout.astro   console shell: horizontal navbar + context bar (owns its own script)
  components/Header.astro   floating pill nav + mobile menu (marketing only)
  components/Footer.astro   4-column footer (marketing only)
  data/mock.ts              every value the console renders — single source of truth
  data/rag.ts               assistant retrieval corpus (48 passages) + starter questions
  pages/index.astro         landing page; content lives in frontmatter arrays
  pages/login.astro         demo sign-in; submitting walks through to /app
  pages/app/index.astro     console: overview + decision queue
  pages/app/tender.astro    console: bidder comparison for one tender
  pages/app/bidder.astro    console: the compliance record (the important screen)
  pages/app/extract.astro   console: upload & extract — intake, pipeline, extracted fields
  pages/app/report.astro    console: report builder + live printed-sheet preview
  pages/app/portals.astro   console: source integration health
  pages/app/audit.astro     console: full audit trail
  styles/global.css         marketing design system
  styles/app.css            console design system (tokens come from global.css)
public/logos/               real portal logos + SOURCES.md
```

**Two surfaces, one token set.** Marketing pages import `global.css`; console pages import
`global.css` (for `:root` tokens and fonts) *then* `app.css`. `app.css` adds `--alert`, `--info`,
`--side-w`, `--top-h` and owns everything from `.app` downwards.

Legacy at repo root, **not part of the build**: `pramaan-landing.html` (the original single-file
version) and `convert.js`. Safe to ignore; delete only if asked.

### Page order (deliberately short — it is a landing page)

**Hero → portals marquee → How it works → FAQ → closing CTA → footer.**

Only `#how` and `#faq` are nav targets. Earlier revisions also had Problem, Capabilities, Impact,
a Tender board and an Evidence chain section; **the user removed all of them on purpose.** Don't
reintroduce sections uninvited — they're in git history if ever wanted back.

Content is **data-driven from frontmatter arrays** (`portals`, `steps`, `faqs`). Edit the array, not
the markup.

---

## Design system (`src/styles/global.css`)

Civic/editorial "ledger" aesthetic — deliberately **not** a generic purple-gradient SaaS page. Warm
parchment ground (`#F2EDE3` — the colour of a file cover, not an off-white screen), warm-neutral ink
(`#1C1A15`, not screen-black), deep navy, gold seal accent, green for verified. Shadows are warm
(brown-black rgba), not blue-grey — cool shadows on parchment read as dirt.

| Token group | Notes |
|---|---|
| Ground | `--paper` **warm parchment** page, `--paper-raised` alternating sections, `--paper-deep` (behind the report sheet, hero logo stack), `--surface` white cards |
| Brand | `--navy` / `--navy-deep`, `--verify` green, `--seal` gold, `--flag` amber for review states |
| Elevation | `--shadow-xs` → `--shadow-xl`; cards use `xs`, hover `lg`, the hero mockup `xl` |
| Radii | `--r-xs` → `--r-xl`, `--r-pill` |
| Type | `--serif` Fraunces (headings), `--sans` IBM Plex Sans (body), `--mono` IBM Plex Mono (labels, IDs, timestamps) |

**Rules that keep it coherent:**

- Mono is for *machine* text only — timestamps, record IDs, portal names, eyebrows, status pills.
  Never body copy.
- Grounds alternate: hero `paper` → portals `raised` → how `paper` → FAQ `raised` → closing `paper`.
  Adding or removing a section means re-checking this alternation; two adjacent same-ground sections
  look like a mistake.
- Section separation is a single `border-top`. `.portals` already has a `border-bottom`, so the
  section after it (`.steps`) carries `border-top:none` — don't "fix" that into a doubled 2px line.
- Green = verified, amber = needs officer review, gold = accent/seal. Amber is never an error colour;
  **nothing on this site is red.**

### The officer console (`/app`)

Frontend only — **no backend yet, by explicit instruction.** Forms and buttons are inert except the
login submit, which navigates to `/app`.

Routes: `/app` (overview + queue) -> `/app/tender` (bidder comparison) -> `/app/bidder` (compliance
record), plus `/app/extract` (upload & extract), `/app/report` (generate report), `/app/portals` and
`/app/audit`. `AppLayout` takes `title`, `active` (nav highlight) and `crumbs`; `active` is a union
of all six nav keys, so adding a route means widening it.

The shell is a **floating pill navbar** (`.appbar`: brand left, centred nav, actions right) —
`position:sticky; top:14px`, `--r-pill` on both ends, translucent white with backdrop blur, gaining
`.scrolled` past 6px like the marketing nav. Beneath it sits an unstyled context row (`.ab-sub`:
breadcrumb + search), then `.content`. All three share
`max-width:min(1340px, calc(100% - 40px))` so their edges line up. Below **1120px** the nav collapses
into `.ab-menu`, a rounded card hanging off the pill — that breakpoint lives in `app.css` *and* in
the resize handler in `AppLayout`; change both together. (It is 1120, not the marketing nav's 1000,
because the console carries six items.) Same light palette throughout — there is no
sidebar; one existed and was replaced.

The active nav item is a **navy underline** under the label, with the label going navy and semibold
— a 2.5px rounded rule inset to the item's padding, sitting inside the pill rather than on its edge.
(An earlier revision used a filled navy pill; the user replaced it — the filled block read as "that
blue thing". Don't restore it.)

UX affordances worth keeping: a `.skip` link to `#main`; `.bulkbar` (a floating action bar that
appears only once rows are selected, driven by `input[data-row]` / `input[data-selall]` and wired
generically in `AppLayout`); `focus-visible` rings on every control; the bidder tabs are a real
`role="tablist"` with arrow/Home/End keys and the open tab mirrored into the URL hash so a refresh
or back button keeps it; the score ring carries `role="img"` with a text equivalent; and
"Record decision" shows an inline confirmation naming the chosen option.

Everything renders from `src/data/mock.ts`, so the same bidder tells one consistent story across
screens. The focus bidder is **Nova Labtech (78/100, Medium)** — deliberately neither a clean pass
nor an obvious reject, so the record has to show the engine reasoning and hand a real judgement over.

Rules this console is built on, worth preserving:

- **The dashboard opens with `.act-rail`** — four entry points above the queue: Upload & extract,
  Generate report, Audit trail and Portal status, in that order. They are entry points, not
  navigation, which is why they sit above the stats strip rather than in the navbar alone. The
  assistant is deliberately *not* one of them — it has its own FAB on every page. Portal status
  carries `.act.flag` (amber) because a source is currently degraded.
- **No explainer prose in the product.** Panels titled "How this ranking is produced" / "How access
  works" were removed on request — they read as AI filler. State things through structure and terse
  labels; a `.meta-row` of facts beats a paragraph. Real controls (tabs, filter chips, sortable
  headers, pagination, row select) are what make it read as software rather than a mockup.
- **Every value carries provenance.** A check row shows source portal, submitted value, retrieved
  value, verdict and timestamp. Never render a bare status.
- **Score is never the decision.** A bidder can score 78 and still fail one qualifying clause. The
  ranking is a review convenience; the decision panel is the point of the screen.
- **A missing source is pending, not passing.** `/app/portals` exists to make that visible.
- The AI recommendation card carries a **confidence figure and an explicit limits note**. Keep both
  if you touch it.
- `.tbl` rows set `grid-template-columns` inline per page and carry `min-width:680px`; the enclosing
  `.panel-body.flush` scrolls horizontally so the page body never does.
- The score ring animates via `--off` (a stroke-dashoffset computed in the page, circumference
  282.7 at r=45) and is disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### The assistant is real retrieval, not a scripted chat

`Ask Pramaan` — a pill FAB bottom-right on every console page (`.ast-launch`, collapses to a circle
under 620px), opening `.ast`, a docked panel. `Ctrl/⌘ K` toggles it, `Escape` closes it.

It is **not** a canned script. `src/data/rag.ts` holds 48 passages (`title`, `source`, `href`,
`answer`, `text`, `keys`); `AppLayout` serialises them into
`<script type="application/json" id="astCorpus">` and the inline script indexes them once
(term frequency + document frequency), then scores each question with BM25-style weighting plus a
bigram bonus and a verbatim-`keys` bonus. The answer is the top passage's `answer`, its `text` as
support, and up to three citation chips linking to the screen the passage came from.

Two rules hold the honesty line, and both matter more than coverage:

- **It answers only from retrieved passages.** Nothing is generated. If the top score is under the
  floor and the question is not covered (`hit >= 2 || key > 0 || hit/terms >= 0.5`), it says the
  record does not cover it and offers the nearest passages instead of improvising.
- **Every passage restates something already on a screen.** Adding a passage that states a *new*
  fact would put an uncitable claim in the officer's hands — write the fact into `mock.ts` and the
  UI first, then describe it here.

Anything on any console page can open it pre-loaded with a question via `data-ask="…"` (an empty
value just opens the panel) — used on the extract and report page heads and on the recommendation
card.

### Upload & extract, and Generate report

`/app/extract` — dropzone (real drag/drop and file picker; files stay in the browser and are
labelled as such), the document list from `mock.documents`, a four-stage pipeline that actually
walks its stages on "Run extraction", and a field-level diff (`.xrow`) of extracted value against
source record. Files a user adds are marked `Not in demo` rather than given invented confidences.

`/app/report` — section checkboxes drive a **live preview of a printed sheet** (`.sheet`, on a
`--paper-deep` desk, with a rotated `Demo environment` stamp). Toggling a section hides its
`[data-pane]` block and recomputes the page count; format is a `.seg` radio group. Generating walks
a progress bar and confirms. The stamp and the sheet footer are the honesty markers — keep them.

### The nav is a floating pill

`header.nav` is `position:sticky; top:16px` and `.nav-inner` is fully rounded (`--r-pill`) with a
translucent blurred background. It gets `.scrolled` from JS past 8px to deepen the shadow. There is
**no announcement bar above it** — one existed and was removed; don't add it back.

### The hero

Left column: pill, a two-line headline (`Eleven portals. / One verified record.` — the accent word
carries a hand-drawn SVG underline that draws itself in), lede, two CTAs, a one-line
human-in-the-loop note, and `.hero-proof` — six **real portal logos** overlapped like a stack of
files plus a `+5` chip. Right column: the app mockup. Below both, `.hero-facts`, a four-cell ledger
strip.

The hero ground is two soft radial washes (seal gold top-right, navy bottom-left) over
`repeating-linear-gradient` **ruled lines** masked out before they become wallpaper, plus an
embossed seal *ring* top-right (`.hero::after`) — an outline, hidden under 980px, and never the
State Emblem.

`.hero-facts` states only claims the copy already makes (11 portals, 38 checks, timestamped, the
officer decides). It is not a place for new metrics.

### The hero mockup carries the page

`.app-shell` — browser chrome plus a bidder compliance dashboard: animated 96/100 gauge, six
staggered verification rows (five matched, one flagged amber), floating "42 min saved" stat card,
subtly rotated in 3D and straightening on hover. With the page this short, it is doing most of the
"this is a real product" work, so treat it as load-bearing.

### Portal logos are real, with two drawn fallbacks

The marquee uses **actual government portal logos** in `public/logos/` — see
[`public/logos/SOURCES.md`](public/logos/SOURCES.md) for the per-file source and licence table.
Each `portals` entry in `index.astro` is either:

- `{ n, logo: 'epfo.png' }` -> renders `<img src={`${base}logos/...`}>`, or
- `{ n, c, icon }` -> renders the hand-drawn SVG glyph (only **GSTN** and **debarment**, which have
  no obtainable/undefined logo).

Rasters are trimmed + downscaled to a 128-160px box and shown in a fixed **54x26** `.chip-logo` box
with `object-fit:contain`, so square emblems and wide wordmarks share one optical footprint without
distorting. Logo `src` **must** go through `${base}` like every other asset.

Two constraints worth keeping:

- `mca21.svg` is **CC BY-SA 4.0** (attribution + share-alike); `pan.png` is public domain. The rest
  are official marks used nominatively to identify the portal being integrated with.
- **Never use the bare State Emblem of India.** A crop of the MSME lockup once reduced it to exactly
  that and was reverted — its use is restricted by the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper
  Use) Act, 2005, and it identifies no particular portal.

### Motion

`.reveal` + `IntersectionObserver` for scroll-in; a count-up on the diagram score.
`prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured globally *and* with explicit per-component overrides (gauge fill,
app rows, float card) — add an override whenever you add an animation that starts at `opacity:0`, or
reduced-motion users get invisible content.

---

## Conventions

- Scripts are `is:inline` vanilla JS in an IIFE, guarded with null checks and an
  `IntersectionObserver in window` fallback. Header owns its own script; page behaviour lives at the
  bottom of `index.astro`.
- Nav breakpoint is **1000px** in both `global.css` and the resize handler in `Header.astro`. Change
  both together.
- Decorative SVGs get `aria-hidden="true"`; meaningful ones get `role="img"` + `aria-label`.
- `.audit-point*` in the FEATURE POINTS block is used **only by `login.astro`**. It survived a
  section deletion once already — check `login.astro` before removing it.

---

## Content caveat — matters for judging

Several figures are **illustrative, not measured**: "42 min saved per bidder" and every value in the
hero mockup (bidder name, tender ID, scores, timings). Don't add *new* invented metrics — fabricated
statistics are the fastest way to lose credibility in a procurement context. The login page is
labelled "Demo environment · credentials are not transmitted" because the form does nothing; keep a
note like that as long as that stays true.

---

## Gotchas

- **An element inside a grid/flex container must have base styles, not only styles inside a
  `@media` block.** The console's old left sidebar had a `.scrim` overlay child of `.app` given
  `position:fixed` only under `max-width:960px`. At desktop it fell back to a plain block, took grid
  **column 2**, and pushed the whole page body onto the next row — five screens rendered as a nav
  next to blank space, while the build passed and the markup was all present. The shell is now a
  flow-level navbar rather than a grid, but the trap returns the moment `.app` becomes a grid again.
  `src/styles/app.css` is audited for this by diffing selectors defined only inside `@media` against
  the classes actually rendered in `dist/app/`.
- **A two-line label written as nested `<span>`s needs `display:block`.** `.who .t .n/.s`,
  `.act .t/.d`, `.rbrow .t/.d`, `.opt .t/.d`, `.fitem .nm/.sub` are all
  `<span><span class="t">…</span><span class="d">…</span></span>`. Inline boxes silently ignore
  `margin-top` *and* `text-overflow:ellipsis`, so the two lines render on one row and long names run
  under the next column — with no error anywhere. They are blockified in one rule near the end of
  `app.css`; keep new label/description pairs in it.
- **Large bash heredocs to write files have failed in this environment** (`unexpected EOF while
  looking for matching`) once the chunk got long, even with a quoted delimiter. Use the Write tool,
  or a Python heredoc, for anything sizeable.
- After editing `global.css`, sanity-check `{` vs `}` counts — Astro/Vite will happily bundle
  unbalanced CSS and the breakage only shows up visually.
- After deleting a section, grep for orphaned anchors (`#capabilities`, `#impact`, …) in
  `Header.astro`, `Footer.astro` and `login.astro`, and for CSS classes with no markup left.
- No browser or screenshot tooling is available here. `npm run build` plus grepping `dist/` for
  expected classes is the practical verification; real visual checks need the user.
